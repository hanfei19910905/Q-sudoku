Q-sudoku
========

a tiny sudoku game, for my homework.
which can be run in the windows.

how to use
==========

the input file is located at sample/text.txt
you can run the exe file directly to see the result in output.txt

and you can run ./time.bat ./**.exe in command line to see the used time

how to compile
==============

if you want to hack the program, you must have mingw tools,(g++ and make)
then run mingw32-make.exe directly.
